This project is a supermarket database created as part of my university coursework. The database is designed and implemented using Microsoft Access. It is meant to simulate the data management system of a typical supermarket, tracking information like product inventory, sales, bills, employees, supplier details, and customer purchases 

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to apply database design and development skills learned in my university course. The database provides a way for the supermarket to better organize their data and perform essential business functions. 


## Entity Relationship Diagram

Prior to development, I created an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) modeling the key entities (tables) and their relationships. The ERD included entities for Products, Customers, Orders, Employees, etc.

The main tables I designed were:

- Users - stores login info like username, password, fullname.
- Customers - stores customer data like name, contact info, etc.
- Employee - stores employee data such as id, name, contact info, etc.
- Products - stores product info like name, category, price, etc.
- Orders - stores info about customer orders.
- OrderItems - stores individual items in each order.
- Bills - stores bill info like bill id, type, date, discount, etc.

## Implementation

I set the data types for each field, like text, number, date/time etc. based on the kind of data that would be stored. I also set primary keys for each table and defined relationships between the tables.

After designing the schema, I created some sample data records in each table to test the database. I ran sample queries, forms and reports to ensure the database was functioning as expected.



## Results

The completed database allows storing all required supermarket information. Queries and forms were created to retrieve and manipulate data easily.

## Conclusion

This project gave me good practice designing and implementing a relational database from scratch using Microsoft Access. I got experience mapping requirements to an initial data model, and then implementing the physical database effectively.

## How to Use

1. Download the `.accdb` file from the repository.

2. Open the file using Microsoft Access.

3. Navigate through the different tables to view and manage the data.


## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank my professor DR. Sara Alsager for their valuable feedback and support throughout this project.
