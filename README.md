# Supermarket-Database
# Supermarket Database Project

For a university project, I created a database to store information about a fictional supermarket using Microsoft Access.

## Overview

The goal of this project was to demonstrate competency in database design and implementation by creating a functional database that could support operations for a supermarket.

## Design

I first designed the conceptual data model defining the main entities (customers, products, orders, etc.) and their relationships. I then created an ERD diagram representing the logical database schema.

The main tables I designed were:

- Customers - stores customer data like name, contact info, etc.
- Products - stores product info like name, category, price, etc.
- Orders - stores info about customer orders
- OrderItems - stores individual items in each order

## Implementation

I implemented the design in Microsoft Access and created the required tables, relationships, and other database objects.

Some key implementation details:

- Used appropriate data types for each field
- Set primary keys and foreign keys properly to represent relationships
- Created indexes on relevant fields like product and customer IDs
- Validated data integrity with constraints
- Created views and queries for retrieving info

## Results

The completed database allows storing all required supermarket information. Queries and forms were created to retrieve and manipulate data easily.

This project gave me good practice designing and implementing a relational database from scratch using Microsoft Access. I got experience mapping requirements to an initial data model, and then implementing the physical database effectively.
